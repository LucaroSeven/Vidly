Additional Challenges for the Vidly Application

As with all developers nobody knows how to do everything and so we tend to learn out of necessity. 
There are no solutions as I want to simulate a real-world scenario. 
When you are at work, you won’t have me next to you nor will you have the solutions provided to you. 
You have to use your knowledge and research to find the solution. 
There is no perfect solution. Every solution has pros and cons. 
So, don’t get hung up on the fact I have not provided my own solutions to these challenges. 
If you get stuck please share your solutions on the discussion board and ask others for their input. 
So be patient if you are having a hard time getting started on how to implement these challenges, but most of all have fun!

	1. Add the ability for end users to check movies in.
	2. Add the logic to limit how many movies a customer can have rented at one time.
	3. Add the ability to allow end users mark customers as delinquent on payment as well as the ability to remove this flag. 
	This could be used so that these customers cannot rent movies until they are no longer delinquent on payment.
	4. Add the ability to allow end users to apply a discounted rate to customers.
	5. Add the ability to allow end users to maintain both users and roles through the user interface. 
	This probably should be limited to an Admin role.
